1) In order for the program to work, you need to creat a file "harvested_data.csv" if it is not already created. The first 4 columns should be named "ItemID", "SystemID", 
"Buying", "Selling" respectively.
2) You have to put the steam screenshots in the folder "ImageDataHarvesting/un_converted_images" if they are in .jpg format and in the folder 
"ImageDataHarvesting/converted_images" if they are alraedy in .png format.
3) If all things above are done correctly, when you start the program, it should start appending the data to the "harvested_data.csv" file.

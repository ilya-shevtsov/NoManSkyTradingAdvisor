1) In order for the program to work, you need to creat a file "harvested_data.csv" if it is not already created. The first 4 columns should be named "ItemID", "SystemID", 
"Buying", "Selling" respectively.
2) When taking screenshots make sure to place your mouse on the little "eye" which is located on the bottom right of the store dispenser. (Take a look in the sample screenshots).
3) You have to put the steam screenshots in the folder "ImageDataHarvesting/un_converted_images" if they are in .jpg format and in the folder 
"ImageDataHarvesting/converted_images" if they are alraedy in .png format.
4) If all things above are done correctly, when you start the program, it should start appending the data to the "harvested_data.csv" file.
